This is a Chess game with a custom Negamax AI.  It is coded using the MonoGame framework and it targets Windows.

There is nothing fancy about the UI.  This is meant to be an excercise in creating a strong AI that can play a game as complicated as chess.  That's all!  There are way better implementations out there (like Stockfish), but I'm doing this as a hobby because I'm interested in AI.
